# Video Game Review Finder App

The Video Game Review Finder App is a web application that allows users to search for their favorite video games and view reviews, authors, and scores for those games. The app utilizes the OpenCritic API to retrieve game data and reviews, providing users with valuable insights into their desired video games.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this app is to provide a convenient way for users to find information about video games, including reviews, authors, and scores. By utilizing the OpenCritic API, users can search for specific games and access critical reviews from various sources, helping them make informed decisions about their gaming choices.

## Features

- Search for video games using keywords or titles.
- View a list of matching games along with their names.
- Click on a game to see detailed information, including reviews, authors, and scores.
- Explore reviews from different authors to get a well-rounded perspective on a game's quality.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this app, several challenges were encountered:

1. **API Integration:** The initial challenge was integrating the OpenCritic API for both game search and reviews. The process involved experimenting with API endpoints and handling data retrieval.

2. **Data Display:** Displaying the retrieved data, including reviews and author information, required careful handling of the JSON responses and mapping them to appropriate UI components.

3. **Debugging:** Debugging was crucial to identify and resolve issues related to data fetching, rendering, and state management.

4. **Styling:** Designing an appealing user interface with appropriate styling was another challenge. The app's layout and visual elements were enhanced with free resources from flaticon.com and freepik.com.

## Ongoing Work

The app is a work in progress, and the development team is actively working on the following:

- **Displaying Reviews:** I am working on resolving the issue related to displaying reviews on the screen. Efforts are being made to ensure that the reviews, authors, and scores are correctly displayed for each game.

- **Sound Effects:** Additional features, such as adding sound effects to buttons, are being implemented to enhance the user experience.
